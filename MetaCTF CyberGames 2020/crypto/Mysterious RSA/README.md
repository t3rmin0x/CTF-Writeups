# Mysterious RSA

## Description
> We found [this mysterious website](https://metaproblems.com/8b2797bf7f420d5ad92e60ba064a55a1/index.php), and we think it's trying to say something, but we're
> having trouble figuring it out. It appears to be broadcasting the same message over and over again like a sort of modern day number station. We're pretty sure 
> the message is encrypted with RSA. Could you take a crack at it? <br>
> **Hint : Same message is being broadcasted...**

## Solution
The link takes us to a website which gives random `N`, `E` and `C` **[ where N = modulus, E = public exponent, C = Ciphertext ]**.

They also hinted us that they are encrypting the `message` with different `N` and `E`.

This leads to the famous [HÃ¥stad's broadcast attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith%27s_attack#H%C3%A5stad%27s_broadcast_attack) where we need to 
collect `E` ciphertexts to perform this attack.

### Collection of Ciphers

Here's the [python script](collect.py) that I used to grab the ciphertexts from that site.
```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# https://metaproblems.com/8b2797bf7f420d5ad92e60ba064a55a1/index.php

import requests as r
import re

file = open('data.txt', 'w')
for i in range(1000):
	res = r.get("https://metaproblems.com/8b2797bf7f420d5ad92e60ba064a55a1/index.php").text
	stripped = re.sub('<[^<]+?>', '', res).split('\n\n')	# regex to get only N, E, C
	print(f"Collected {i+1}")

	n = stripped[0]
	e = stripped[1]
	ct = stripped[2]

	# store the N, C pairs in diff files with filename E
	with open(e[2:]+'.txt', 'a') as f:
		f.writelines(n+'\n'+ct)

```
### The Attack
I found a script on Github and modified it for the Attack. Download the [0x43.txt](0x43.txt) file to test.
