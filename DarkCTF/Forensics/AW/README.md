> "Hello, hello, Can you hear me, as I scream your Flag! " [File](https://mega.nz/file/O19ilb5L#VfJFpu9XIqGOpouDYC7TQMsGDRpVyc1pXBWGDx4oXPk)

## Solution
Yeah! I like this song (^ . ^) and I was enjoying the video but we need the flag (- . -)

* I watched the given video twice and also tried to go through the [original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJnBTPUQS5A) on YouTube to check 
if something is fishy or not but didn't find anything.

* Then I tried to open the file in Audacity and observed the Spectrogram. The flag was there!
