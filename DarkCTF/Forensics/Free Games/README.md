## Description
>Wolfie getting free games from somewhere. Find the full url to that game.<br>
Note: Use the same file provided in Wolfie's Contacts Flag Format: `darkCTF{http://site}`

## Solution
I tried to do this one on my Kali VM but failed :( So I installed Autopsy in my windows host<br>
I found a zip in the `downlaods` folder. In the zone identifier I found the required link.
